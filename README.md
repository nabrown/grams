An Instagram gallery using Vue.js and CSS Grid

This is the code for a simple gallery displaying your most recent instagram posts. 

It uses Vue.js, Axios, and CSS Grid, and I wrote a [Medium post explaining the code](https://itnext.io/an-instagram-gallery-with-vue-js-and-css-grid-c0a2d7cc3e0f).

Note, is uses Instagram API access that is supposed to [shut down in 2020](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/01/30/instagram-graph-api-updates/).
